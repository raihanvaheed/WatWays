# WatWays

WatWays is an Android application designed to help students at the University of Waterloo find the shortest indoor paths around campus. This is especially useful during the cold winter months or on rainy days when walking outside is less desirable. WatWays is a successor to the previously popular WatisRain app, which has not been updated since 2016.

This is my first time undertaking a public project with multiple contributors, and I am happy to learn from the active UWaterloo community. This project is currently a work in progress, so keep an eye out for updates!

## Features

- **Interactive Campus Map**: View the University of Waterloo campus map.
- **Shortest Path Finder**: Calculate the shortest indoor path between two buildings using bridges, tunnels, and indoor connections.
- **Zoom and Pan**: Easily navigate the map with zoom and pan functionality.
- **Building Information**: Click on buildings to get more information.
